Tribes-Training-Tool
====================

A program to train your Tribes: Ascend capping skill. This fork is different from Fr0sZ's in that it removes some (in my opinion) useless features and is more focussed on capping. I don't expect these changes to be merged.

Only works in offline training mode.

## Feature ideas
- Booster, gain speed instantaneously
- Energy reset
- Replay Scrubbing / Slowmotion
- Replay / Warp Integration
- Overlay
- Insta respawns
- Rockbounce consistency checker
- Icon (sanic?)
- Improve GUI

Made by Fr0sZ, forked by CptSemer
